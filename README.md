Execute by opening command line in app directory (where you put the .py file) and call by executing 'python3 .\Fast_Astronomical_Image_Viewer.py'. This will spawn an interactive GUI that prompts you to select a .fits file to extract image data from.

Image can be displayed by selecting an image and clicking "Analyze File". 

Keep in mind that these images are (typically) infrared or in a non-visible wavelength, so data must be mapped to a colormap to be visible. The drop-down menu present in the UI can switch between multiple color maps.
